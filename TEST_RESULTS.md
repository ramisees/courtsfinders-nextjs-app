# Court Finder - Error Testing Report

## Test Results Summary âœ…

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Status:** ALL TESTS PASSING

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing `available` Property
**Problem:** Courts data didn't include the `available` property needed for booking status display.
**Fix:** Added `available: true/false` to all court records in both `/api/courts` and `/api/search` endpoints.

### 2. Search API Data Inconsistency
**Problem:** Search API had different data structure than Courts API (using `type` vs `sport`, `location` vs `address`, etc.).
**Fix:** Standardized all court data to use consistent field names across all APIs.

### 3. Search API File Corruption
**Problem:** Search API route file became corrupted during editing.
**Fix:** Recreated the search API route file with proper data structure and error handling.
