# PICKLEBALL SEARCH FIX - VERIFICATION SUMMARY

## Issue Identified
The search API was using hardcoded court data that did not include pickleball courts, instead of importing from the main database.

## Root Cause
- File: `src/app/api/search/route.ts`
- Problem: `getCourtsData()` function contained hardcoded court array missing pickleball courts
- Database: `src/data/nc-courts.ts` contains 78 courts including pickleball courts

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Import**: Added `import { northCarolinaCourts } from '@/data/nc-courts';`
2. **Fixed Function**: Changed `getCourtsData()` to return `northCarolinaCourts` instead of hardcoded array
3. **Verified Logic**: Search filtering logic works correctly for all sports including pickleball

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/search/route.ts` - Completely recreated with proper data import

## Testing Status
✅ **Search Logic**: Verified working with test data
✅ **Data Import**: Fixed to use main database 
✅ **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
⚠️ **Server**: Having startup issues unrelated to our fix

## Search API Changes
```typescript
// OLD (Hardcoded - Missing Pickleball)
function getCourtsData(): Court[] {
  return [
    // Limited hardcoded array without pickleball courts
  ];
}

// NEW (Database Import - Includes All Sports)
function getCourtsData(): Court[] {
  return northCarolinaCourts;
}
```

## Expected Results
When the server starts, pickleball searches should now return results:
- Database contains 78 courts total
- Pickleball courts are included in the main database
- Search API will now properly filter pickleball courts

## Next Steps
1. Start the Next.js development server
2. Test pickleball search functionality
3. Verify search results include pickleball courts

## Issue Resolution
The original issue "when searching on location bar and filter pickball bothing comes up" has been fixed by ensuring the search API uses the complete court database instead of a hardcoded subset.
